First of all, the dataset files were converted to .csv files, for easier manipulation using Python's pandas.
<br>
Most of the assumptions made in order to change or correct any data, were based on the information found on a very good website that contains fact about the Titanic Disaster.
That includes numbers and statistics about the victims and survivors, also about the ship, and the disaster itself.

Altough this website has much more information, what I mainly used were the: <b>/titanic-passengers/</b>; <b>/titanic-survivors/</b> and <b>/titanic-victims/</b>.
